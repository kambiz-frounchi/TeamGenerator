# Team Generator

## Description

This app is a CLI based Node.js application that generates an HTML page summarazing all the employees in a given team. The user uses the CLI to input each employee's info. The CLI asks for new employees until the user indicates that they are done. 

The app accepts three employee types: a Manager, an engineer and an intern. All employee types share a name, id and email. There are also specific attributes for each employee type. For example managers have an office number, engineers have a github username and interns have a school attribute.

The app uses inquirer for the CLI. It has also taken advantage of the async/await paradigm.
